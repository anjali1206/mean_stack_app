Cheanges I want to add in this app later on:

- Add feature like "medium.com/gitter.com" for direct login/signup/register with social media accounts
- Name should be shown in the user profile
- There should be a warning if user clicks on sign up button without correct confirm password input instead of showing errmsg for password field.
- Email should show just the firstname from the name of user and not the whole name. for ex.'Anjali' and not "Anjali Rathod"
- In resend activation link email, add more text & options like "It this wasn't you, who requested new activation link, you don't have to do anything.....or check back with your account....or contact us for support... etc"
